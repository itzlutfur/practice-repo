# Backend Practice with Node.js

This repository is dedicated to practicing backend development using **Node.js**. Here, you'll find various code samples, exercises, and mini-projects as I explore different backend concepts and technologies.

## What to Expect

- Practice code for Node.js fundamentals
- REST API examples
- Middleware and routing exercises
- Database integration samples (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- Authentication and authorization demos
- Error handling and testing

## Notes

- This repo is for learning and experimentation.
